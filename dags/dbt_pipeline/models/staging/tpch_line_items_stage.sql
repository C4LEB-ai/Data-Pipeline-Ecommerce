-- -- A surrogate key in dbt (and in data modeling generally) is a unique identifier for a row in a model or table that is not derived from the source systemâ€™s natural key. Itâ€™s typically used to:
-- 	â€¢	Uniquely identify a record when no reliable natural key exists.
-- 	â€¢	Track slowly changing dimensions (SCDs).
-- 	â€¢	Join across tables where composite keys are unwieldy.
-- ðŸ”‘ Example in dbt
-- In dbt, a surrogate key is often generated using a hash function like dbt_utils.surrogate_key or the built-in md5()/sha() functions.
